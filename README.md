# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template discord.js bot, and can be used as a bot "base" to expand upon or as a sandbox for trying out news ideas, concepts, and testing.

It's purpose is essentially to be the "basics" of your discord.js bot- this includes, but is not limited to:

- Improved console logging (timestamps and logging levels/labels)
- Powerful command and event handlers
- Live reloadable commands, events, and listeners
- Default message parser supports configurable prefix + mention prefix support implemented properly
- Comes with a full set of default commands for pinging, shutdown, changing bot username or avatar, etc
- Ability to login either with a persisted token (stored in config.json) or non-persisted (command prompt argument)
- Batch script for running & automatically restarting the bot

This way, you don't need to write these things yourself- they're already made, the wheel already reinvented, and you can pull fixes and improvements from sandplate as they occur.

### This project is not ready yet

However, it's purpose is **not** to skip learning how to code these things- In fact, to use sandplate properly, you will need to understand how they're implemented, along with how to use them, and I don't use the word "understand" lightly.

That said, for programmers, the barrier to entry will be very small- The project & this repository will launch when it reaches v1.0.0, which includes fully fledged documentation :)

And, about that... For the time being, this repository is codeless. I'm working on sandplate alone and trying to get it the best I can before I give it to the world ^^;

v1.0.0 will mark feature completion and spec finalization, and as aformentioned, include fully fledged documentation, so that's when this project will launch/go live.

## Invites

The bot account itself is private for the time being. After the project reaches v1.0.0, the bot will be freely invitable.
