# Melted Cheese

An unnamed project for playing board games over discord, forked from [sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate) for the discord bot base.

This is highly experimental, and is more or less just a prototype at the moment. If you're interested, you can join our [discord](https://discord.gg/xSMRMmYefR).
