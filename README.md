# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template discord.js bot, and a sandbox for new ideas/concepts/testing.

Repo is currently without code at the moment, it'll be pushed when it's ready, and anyone will be welcome to contribute from then on.

## Invites

The bot account itself is private for the time being. After the project goes live, the bot will be freely addable.
