# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) bot, and can be used as a base to expand upon.

It's current goal (and eventual purpose) is to cover all of the "basics" of a discord bot's internals, such as, but not limited to:

- Framework for commands and event modules
- Reloadable command and event modules
- Command access control
- Improved console logging (timestamps and labels)
- Configurable command prefixes and mention prefix support

This way, you won't need to write these things in full yourself- they'd be available to expand upon and use, whatever your purposes, and you could pull fixes and improvements from this repository as they occur.

However, the idea isn't that this lets you skip learning how to code what sandplate would do for you. Rather, to make use of sandplate in any meaningful way, you'll need to know how it's implemented.

Sandplate is now in initial development, during which it isn't intended for any real use, and anything may change at any time.

Progress can be found over in the [`initial-development`](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/tree/initial-development) branch and on our [`1.0.0` milestone](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/milestone/1).
