# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template discord.js bot, and can be used as a bot "base" to expand upon.

It's purpose is essentially to be the "basics" of a discord bot, to serve as a framework and single repository you can pull fixes and improvements from, rather than rewriting code if you have multiple bots.

However, it's purpose is not to skip learning how to code or implement the things it does, rather, to make use of sandplate in any meaningful way, you'll need to understand how they're implemented.

At first, the project was going to be developed up to major version `1.0.0` in private, where the project would then launch publicly, but that plan was a mistake.

Rather, the repository has been cleaned up and initial development (major version `0.x.x`) will be carried out in it's own branch: [`initial-development`](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/tree/initial-development)

Major version 0 is not for production purposes, and cannot be considered stable. Anything may change at any time.
